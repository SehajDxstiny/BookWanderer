1. find folder where the sentence models are stored, delete the ones not being used
2. the strings don't give individual information, so connect them with the original dictionaries
3. how to download from URLS, downloading top books locally. 




later ideas:

match google book thumbail (clip embedding) with other sites thumbnails too hehehe
